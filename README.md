## NEMPay

*NEMPay at the moment only works in the test net*.

NEMPay is an app developed by Atraura Blockchain to transfer assets in an easy way, directly from mobile devices, using NEM Blockchain.  Just selecting the asset to be sent from your balance, typing recipient address and amount to be sent, you can make a quick transaction in just few seconds.

Companies and individuals can take advantage of NEMPay in order to make an app for their own mosaic and namespace. The cost of acquisition it is lower, as there is no need to code a new app.

Currently, the app is available for Android and iOS.
